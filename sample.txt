Hi, welcome to @Manipal$
We are in the 5th Semester!
This is our Operating Systems Mini Project :)

Using the WC command implemented in our project, we can count the numbers of bytes, characters, words and lines. 
We can also search for the occurrence of a particular word and get to know how many paragraphs, comments lines and special characters are in the program. 
Additionally, it can display the longest line in a given C file or text file.

//This is a comment

/*
This is another 
multiline
comment
*/
